[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/node-schedule.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/node-schedule/)

node-schedule is a flexible both cron-like and not-cron-like job scheduler for Node.js. It allows you to schedule jobs (arbitrary functions) for execution at specific dates, with optional recurrence rules. It only uses a single timer at any given time (rather than reevaluating upcoming jobs every second/minute).
